# NF17-Database-application

This project was part of a database course. We did it last year in group of 4 students.
We had to implement what was written and designed (see the UML) in the report.
So we made hypothesis to be able to implement imprecisions. 
You can see the codes, and our sql script. 

let me know if you find something wrong or if you want to ask a question.
